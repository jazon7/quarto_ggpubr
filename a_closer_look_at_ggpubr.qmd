# Prerequisites

Load required packages:

```{r}
library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, rio, ggpubr, rstatix, scales, flextable)
```

# Introduction

If you are using R there is a very good chance you are creating plots using the `ggplot2` package.

What you might not know is that there are now over 100 registered extensions available which support and/or extend `ggplot2`[^1].

[^1]: [ggplot2 extensions gallery](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/)

One of my favourites is `ggpubr` - a package that provides some easy-to-use functions for creating clean and publication ready plots.

Let's see what `ggpubr` has to offer using the [sports car price](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/sports-car-prices-dataset) data set.

# Are faster sports cars more expensive?

![](images/sport_car.jpg){width="671"}

The question we want to answer is will spending more money on a sports car gets you a faster car?

To answer this question we will create a plot and leverage some of the functions provided by `ggpubr`.

Start by downloading and importing the data set:

```{r}
data <- rio::import("sport_car_price.csv") %>% 
  as_tibble()
flextable::flextable(data %>% head)
```

Then clean up the data and convert time taken to reach 60 mph (in seconds) from a continuous to a categorical variable:

```{r }
data <-
  data %>% filter(!grepl("Electric", `Engine Size (L)`)) %>% 
  filter(`Engine Size (L)` != "N/A") %>% 
  filter(`Engine Size (L)` != "0") %>% 
  filter(`Engine Size (L)` != "-") %>%
   filter(!grepl("Hybrid", `Engine Size (L)`)) %>%
  distinct(`Car Make`,`Car Model`,Year,`Engine Size (L)`,Horsepower, `Torque (lb-ft)`, .keep_all = TRUE)

data <- data %>% 
  mutate(across(everything(), ~str_replace_all(., ",","")))

data <- data %>% 
  mutate(across(c(`Price (in USD)`,`Horsepower`, `Torque (lb-ft)`, `Engine Size (L)`, `0-60 MPH Time (seconds)`),
         as.numeric))

data <- data %>% 
  mutate(`time(0-60mph)`=  cut(`0-60 MPH Time (seconds)`, breaks = c(2, 2.9, 4 , Inf),
     labels = c("< 3", "3-4", "> 4"),
     include.lowest = TRUE))

data <- data %>% 
  rename(price = `Price (in USD)`)

flextable::flextable(data %>% 
                       select(-`Engine Size (L)`, -Horsepower, -`Torque (lb-ft)`, -`0-60 MPH Time (seconds)`) %>% 
                       head())%>%
  align_text_col(align = "right") %>%
  flextable::set_table_properties(layout = "autofit",  width = 1) 
```

Then create boxplots comparing the price of the 0-to-60 mph groups using `ggplot2` basic settings:

```{r warning=FALSE}
plot <- 
  ggplot(data, aes(x=`time(0-60mph)`, y=price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes( fill = `time(0-60mph)`)) +
  ylab("Price (USD)") +
  xlab("Time 0-60 mph (sec)")

plot
```

The default `ggplot2` look and feel is OK, but could definitely be improved.

This is where `ggpubr` can help.

### Theme

First add the `theme_pubr()` theme to the plot:

```{r warning=FALSE}
plot <- plot + ggpubr::theme_pubr()
plot
```

Then add the colour palette taken from the New England Journal of Medicine with the `set_palette` function:

```{r warning=FALSE}
plot <- plot %>% 
  ggpubr::set_palette(palette = "nejm") +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')

plot
```

This is a much better looking plot, but the price is in scientific notation and the price range across groups is so large that it is making the boxplots appear compressed.\
\
Let's further improve the plot.

## Scales

Using the `scales` package, set the y-axis to a logarithmic scale and convert it to dollar labels:

```{r}
plot <- plot +
  scale_y_continuous(
    trans = 'log10',
    labels = scales::label_dollar(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()
                                  ),
    breaks = scales::breaks_log(n = 5),
    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))
    )

plot
```

## Statistics

We can also improve the plot by adding statistics.\
\
In combination with the `rstatix` package, `ggpubr` can make adding statistical labels to a plot relatively easy.

To add statistics, use the `t_test` function from the `rstatix` package to create a data frame with the comparisons required[^2]:

[^2]: I [adjusted the alpha (Î±) level](https://www.statology.org/bonferroni-correction/) so that the probability of committing a type I error is controlled for. I also had to rename the time(0-60mph) variable to time. This is because the `t_test` function could not find the variable when it was input with back ticks (\`) which is the only way I know how when there is a numeric value within the name.

```{r}
stat_test <- data %>% 
  rename(time = `time(0-60mph)`) %>% 
  rstatix::t_test(price ~ time, detailed = TRUE) %>%
  rstatix::adjust_pvalue(method = "bonferroni") %>%
  rstatix::add_significance("p.adj")

flextable::flextable(stat_test)
```

We can now add the significance values to our plot:

```{r warning=FALSE}
# Add p-values onto the box plots
stat_test <- 
  stat_test %>%
  add_y_position(y.trans = log10,
                 step.increase = 0.5)

plot <- plot + 
  stat_pvalue_manual(
  stat_test,  
  label = "{p.adj.signif}",
  tip.length = 0.005,
  size = 6
  )

plot
```

Now make some final adjustments to the plot[^3]:

[^3]: Increase the axis text and title size and add the average price to the boxplot represented as a grey dot.

```{r}
f1 <- function(x) {
  log10(mean(10 ^ x)) 
}

plot <- plot +
  stat_summary(fun.y = f1, colour = 'grey', size = 1.5) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 24))
plot
```

And there we have a really clean looking plot that is easy to read and shows statistical significance.

# Conclusion

`ggpubr` is a fantastic extension to `ggplot2` and makes it easy to turn good plots into ***great*** plots. \
\
So does spending more money on a sports car get you a faster car?

Thanks to `ggpubr`, we can see that on average the \> 4 second cars are the least expensive, the 3-4 seconds cars are in the middle, and the \< 3 seconds cars are the most expensive.\
\
Thus, spending more money on a sports car does appear to buy you a faster car.
